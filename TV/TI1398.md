    TITLE  :  tools.h++ from Rogue Wave conflicts with Turbo Vision




  Tools.h++ from Rogue Wave conflicts with Turbo Vision.

  The header file defs.h from Rogue Wave Tools.h++ contains these
  lines:

      // The following is for your convenience and can be removed
      // if it conflicts with some other package:
      #define Boolean RWBoolean

  If you are using Tools.h++ with Turbo Vision, it will lead to
  conflicts since TV has the following definition for Boolean:

      enum Boolean { TRUE, FALSE };

  Commenting out the #define in defs.h from Tools.h++ resolves the
  conflict.

  In the case where this was initially encountered, a virtual
  function being redefined in a derived class was seen by the
  compiler to have a different signature. Thus, instead of being a
  redefinition, it hid the base class function. Then a call to
  (baseClass*)->virtualFunction got the base class function instead
  of the intended derived class' version.
