I was looking for some CPU which will be modern and has more MIPs than 68030, which is used by last Atari computer Falcon. Freescale, todays Motorola, sells development kit M5485EVBE. This kit contents mini-ITX baseboard, Fire Engine module which is ColdFire CPU daughter board, debugger and Code Warrior IDE. It is all I need. Price in europe is â‚¬1,526.50 and in USA $850. So I've decided that I will buy it in USA. I had a look at ebay and had a good luck. I bought it for ONLY $125 plus shipment fee. 

Everythink is working properly, only power suplly said good bye and flash memory has been rewritten so I will have to burn original content at first step.

### 2.1 First Flasing

Included BDM is somethink similar to JTAG. It is for flashing memory and debugging. Now I need software. CFFlasher is application for flashing memories. Code Warrior is able to flash memory too. There are binary or S-rec file types which can be flasing. Original bootloader was dBug. I finally will want to use uBoot. So it does not matter. First message is BDM device not found. Problems with drivers solved and than after correct settings board has been correctly flashed and uBoot said welcome.

## 3. First program

Started Code Warrior IDE

Application is generated by IDE, only uart initialization and write to uart is added. So simply afrer click Run, application is compiled, linked, uploaded into board and debugging started. I was able to trace program line by line hitting F10.
